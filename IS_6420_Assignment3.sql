group by product_id 
order by product_id asc 
;

--3. For each product, list its ID and total quantity ordered. Products should be listed in descending order of total quantity ordered.

--5. List the name for all customers, who have placed 10 or more orders. Each customer name should appear exactly once. 
--Customer names should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order.

-- Assumption: If "orders" refers to the "number of order ids" placed by each
-- customer, the below solution will work fine

select distinct (c.customer_name)

join order_header oh on c.customer_id = oh.customer_id
group by c.customer_name
having  COUNT(oh.order_id) >= 10
order by c.customer_name asc;

--Assumption: If "orders" refers to "number of quantity ordered", then the below
--solution will work

--7. For each city, list the number of customers from that city, who have placed 3 or more orders. Cities are listed in ascending alphabetical order.

-- Assumption: If "order" refers to the "number of order ids" placed by each
--customer, the below solution will work fine

      having count(oh.order_id)>=3)c1
group by c1.city 
order by c1.city asc;


--8. Implement the previous using a subquery and IN.


select c.city,count(c.customer_id) as no_of_customers 
from customer c 
where c.customer_id in (select distinct (oh.customer_id) 
						from order_header oh

group by c.city 
order by c.city asc;



--9. List the ID for all products, which have NOT been ordered on Dec 5, 2019 or before. Sort your results by the product id in ascending order.  Use EXCEPT for this query.
